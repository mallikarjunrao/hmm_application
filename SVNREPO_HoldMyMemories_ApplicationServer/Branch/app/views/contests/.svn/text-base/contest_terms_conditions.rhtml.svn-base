The First Phase of auditions will be on-site at one of the 4 locations mentioned above which will begin at approximately 10:05 am and will continue until all 210 registered contestants have auditioned.  The Second Phase will be conducted on-line at HoustonFamilyMagazine.com and HoldMyMemories.com.  First Phase: All entrants will perform before a panel of judges.  Each entrant will be asked their name and where he or she is from, and then will have up to 60 seconds to sing or dance, either unaccompanied or with a CD provided by the contestant, to the song of his/her/their choice.  In the event any participant performs any original music on the contest written by said participant, or by any other person, and such music is not currently being administered by a music publisher, participant represents and warrants that prior to his/her performance of such original music, that he/she has obtained all rights necessary (including but not limited to music publishing and synchronization rights) to perform such music, and to grant to Houston Family Magazine and Studio One to One, HoldMyMemories.com the rights required to exploit and the ancillary rights therein in any and all media now known or hereafter devised, or for any other purpose, throughout the universe in perpetuity.  At the sole discretion of the judging panel, each entrant may be allowed to exceed the 60 second time limitation or may be asked to stop before 60 seconds has elapsed.  Entrants will be judged by a score sheet from each judge.  In order for any entrant to continue to the second phase of the contest, that entrant must receive a high score with the highest score being 30.  Second Phase: During the second phase of the selection process, a maximum of 55 entrants from each of the 4 auditions will be posted on-line at HoustonFamilyMagazine.com and HoldMyMemories.com for one week following the audition and will be voted for by the general public.  All phase two participants will be selected by the number of votes received.  In order to continue to the third phase of the contest, entrants must receive the highest number of votes.  The top 25 contestants from each week will then proceed to the Third Phase of the contest.  Houston Family Magazine will list, on-line, the top 25 contestants after each weeks voting period.  In the event of a tie, the Houston Family Magazine, Studio One to One and HoldMyMemories.com Directors, will select, at their sole discretion, the qualifiers and/or alternates, from among those who tied.  Entrants not included on the list will be dismissed and are not eligible to compete further in the contest.  Third Phase: During the third phase entrants will be asked to perform on stage at the Houston Children&rsquo;s Festival and will have up to 3 minutes to perform, to the song of their choice.  All entrants will be judged based on vocal talent or dance skill and technique, stage presence, and overall performance.  Each contestant will be given a minimum of 0 and maximum 10 points for each of the three categories for a possible maximum total of 30 points.  In addition, each judge will have up to 5 discretionary points to award a contestant, for a possible point total of 35.  The participants with the twenty-five highest scores will be notified on Saturday, April 4, 2009.    Three additional entrants, in descending order of score, will be selected as alternates.  In the event that one of the originally selected qualifiers is not able to participate, the first alternate will be contacted.  If the first alternate is unable to participate, then the second alternate will be contacted.  This process will continue until an alternate is found that is able to participate in the contest.  Any qualifier who is unable to participate in this contest on Sunday, April 5, 2009 will be declared ineligible and cannot participate further in the contests, or claim or receive any prize.   In the event of a tie, the Houston Family Magazine, Studio One to One and HoldMyMemories.com Directors, will select, at their sole discretion, the qualifiers and/or alternates, from among those who tied.
