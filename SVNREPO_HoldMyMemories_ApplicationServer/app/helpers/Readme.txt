PREREQUESITES

To submit any kind of transaction (even test transactions) to Authorize.Net, you need to provide valid Authorize.Net payment gateway account information (a valid merchant API login ID and transaction key).

To obtain a test API Login ID and transaction key, you may register for a developer test account at http://developer.authorize.net in order to develop and troubleshoot your integration solution using the Authorize.Net test environment.

Please note that live integration for a merchant payment gateway account must be updated with the merchant's unique Authorize.Net API login ID and transaction key in order to operate successfully.
