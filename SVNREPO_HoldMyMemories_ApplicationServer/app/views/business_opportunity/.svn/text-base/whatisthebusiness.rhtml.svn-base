<p align="center" class="heading"><strong>WHAT IS THE BUSINESS OF HOLD MY MEMORIES?</strong></p>
<table width="80%"><tr><td align="left">
  <p class="cont">The business revolves around two related service and product offerings which interact and promote each other.  The first is an on-location photography service, and the second is a completely unique product for organizing, storing, and sharing memories.</p>
  <p  class="cont">The on-location photography service is a low-cost, scalable business format for providing reasonably priced, professional-quality photography services and products to families, individuals, groups, and organizations.  Because we own a professional photofinishing lab, we can maintain quality standards, quick turnaround, and very competitive pricing.    </p>
  <p  class="cont">During the sales presentation, each client is introduced to HoldMyMemories.com by providing them with a free basic site with their photo session already uploaded.  This is a unique, value-added benefit of using an HMM Certified Photographer.  The HMM site, which is a low-cost, subscription-based product, provides clients with the ability to easily organize, store, and share images, home video, documents, and audio clips..</p>
  <p  class="cont">The combination of great photography at a reasonable cost and the ideal vehicle for organizing, storing, and sharing the client’s favorite memories assures you will become the client’s preferred photographer for life.  Exceeding customer expectations will generate repeat and referral business, assuring you a prosperous future as an HMM Certified Photographer.</p>
