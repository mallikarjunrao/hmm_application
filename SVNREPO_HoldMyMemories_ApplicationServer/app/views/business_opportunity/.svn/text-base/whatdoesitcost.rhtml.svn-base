  <p  class="cont">Unlike many franchise systems with start up costs of several hundred  thousand dollars and high fixed costs, HMM has striven to make this an  attractive opportunity for everyone that would like to earn money from  their photography.  HMM does not charge an ongoing royalty – you pay a  one-time certification fee.  And, there are no hidden charges to be  discovered later.</p>
  
  <p  class="cont">The certification fee is $2,500.  This covers our costs in locating,  vetting, and training the best operators.  Part of the process is  determining whether an applicant is suited to becoming an HMM Certified  Photographer.  We do perform both a criminal background check and an  examination of your credit history.  As an HMM Certified Photographer  you will be working with families and children in the home.  You also  may receive payment before the product is delivered.  We will take  every precaution to make sure every HMM Certified Operator will at all  times and in every situation exhibit conduct that is safe, fair, and  without even the appearance of impropriety.</p>
  <p  class="cont">We’ve estimated $5,000 for an equipment package (Or less, if you already own professional-grade equipment.), to include the items  detailed below. The below items constitute our ‘preferred equipment  package’.  If you already have high-quality equipment you prefer to  use, or if you choose to acquire different equipment, we may not be  able to support you should you have operational and/or technical  trouble in the field.  We’re unable to support every possible  combination of equipment as it interacts in the field with every  possible set of variable session conditions.  We’ve selected the  equipment below for its cost, durability, ease of use, and consistent  high performance. </p>
