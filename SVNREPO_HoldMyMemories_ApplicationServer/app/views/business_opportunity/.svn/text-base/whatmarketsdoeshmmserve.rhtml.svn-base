<table width="80%"><tr><td align="left">
  <p class="cont">Unlike a rigid franchise model, as an HMM Certified Photographer you are free to market your services to the consumers you are most comfortable shooting and with the greatest demand in your area.  The HMM business model is centered around capturing memories, so our most successful operators focus on memorable, family-based, photographic events. </p>
  <p  class="cont">We believe HMM is best suited for:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Birthday  parties, family portraits, and pet portraits<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maternity,  glamour, and romantic portraits<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senior,  bridal, and prom night portraits<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reunions,  corporate, and groups<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Green  screen, storybook, and specialty photography</p>
  <p  class="cont">With training and experience, you can work within all these markets.&nbsp;  Or you can narrow your focus to specialize on a particular niche, or to  address an unmet demand in your particular area.&nbsp;.</p>
