<p align="center" class="heading"><strong>WHAT IS THE BUSINESS OF HOLD MY MEMORIES?</strong></p>
<table width="80%"><tr><td align="left">
  <p class="cont">Welcome!  And thank you for your interest in Hold My  Memories.  We believe the photomarketing industry is ripe for drastic  reinvention.  We believe it is time for the industry to both return to  its roots and to use technology to evolve to its next logical step.  Is  this a contradiction?  Not at all!</p>
  <p  class="cont">George Eastman, in the  pioneering days of photography, made clear to his sales force at Kodak  that they were not in the business of selling cameras, or prints, or  film.  He patiently explained they were in the business of selling  memories - memories of family, and good times.  He believed Kodak was  in the business of capturing memories.</p>
  <p  class="cont">At that time, a paper  print was the ideal vehicle for capturing, sharing, and storing a  memory, or an image.  The paper print was portable – it could be  carried in wallet or purse, or mailed with a letter.  And the paper  print could be stored – it could be framed or held in an album for  decades, even a century.  Paper prints were a fantastic solution to  that consumer need.</p>
    <p  class="cont">Times  have changed, however.  Consumers still want to share and store  memories.  But paper prints are no longer the best vehicle for sharing  and storing images.  Consumers don’t want to carry wads of prints in  their wallet or purse; they prefer to store images on their mobile  phone or iPod.  Consumers don’t want to mail a paper print in an  envelope to a distant friend or relative, they want to share it  electronically.  </p>
  <p  class="cont">Yet the photomarketing industry, for the  most part, remains centered around selling paper prints even though  technology and consumer needs have advanced.  Each successive  generation will have less and less use for paper prints, and the market  for these once-ubiquitous products will continue to dwindle.    </p>
  <p  class="cont">The  core idea of Hold My Memories (HMM) is to marry a flexible, scalable,  low-overhead photography service with today’s technology to address  today’s consumer needs.  HMM isn’t based on paper prints; it is based  on electronic images.  HMM is an evolutionary way to store and share  images electronically.  HMM has evolved beyond a traditional  photography business – far beyond.  </p>
  <p  class="cont">As an HMM certified  photographer, you can be on the leading edge of the next generation of  photomarketing…or really imagemarketing.  It is time for the industry  to reorient itself around the image, and not the paper print.  As an  HMM certified photographer, you will be ideally positioned to introduce  a product to your clients that is as perfectly suited to their present  needs as the paper print was in its day.  When your clients see their  family’s images on their individual and private HMM site you’ve created  just for them, and you demonstrate how they can add their own content,  and easily organize it, and share it with others, they will recognize  it as the perfect solution for their family’s needs and wonder why this  product wasn’t introduced years ago.  They will show it to everyone  they know, and each person that sees it will be a referral for you.  </p>
  <p  class="cont">As  an HMM Certified Photographer, you have an opportunity to build a  lasting relationship with each client.  You will always be known to the  family as the person that introduced them to this remarkable new  product.  You will have the opportunity, and the honor, of acquiring a  customer for life with each HMM session.  Your clients will still want  high-quality images, because they will still want to capture memories  of their family and good times.  Capturing those images will be your  role.    </p>
  <p class="cont">The advent of digital photography has rocked the  photomarketing industry.  As paper print sales continue to decline,  more and more photographers, photofinishing labs, and related  industries will be shaken out.  As an HMM certified photographer, you  will not merely survive but prosper because you already will have made  the transition to marketing images, rather than paper prints.  If you  have an adventurous spirit, a genuine affection for people, and a  passion for photography, we invite you to join us as the photomarketing  industry becomes the imagemarketing industry.</p>
  <p  class="cont">Let’s get started!</p>
